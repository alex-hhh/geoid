;; Return the cost of the optimal mapping between two paths of waypoints
;; (expressed as vectors of geoids).  The lower the cost, the more closely the
;; two paths match each other (even if they don't have the same number of
;; waypoints).  The cost should be zero for a path compared against itself,
;; but we have an error of about 0.04 (4cm) per waypoint.  The cost will also
;; be proportional to the number of waypoints in the path, so to determine if
;; the two paths are the same, the length of the path needs to be taken into
;; account.
;;
;; This algorithm runs in quadratic time, O(vector-length SOURCE) x
;; (vector-length TARGET), and also uses memory proportional to this quadratic
;; time.
;;
;; Straightforward dynamic time warping implementation, currently used to
;; compare it to `dtw/memory-efficient`, but could also be used to extract the
;; actual mapping between waypoints in the two paths.
