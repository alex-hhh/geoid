I welcome pull requests, but before you submit one, please **create an issue**
with a good description of the **bug** you found, the **new feature** you
would like or the **documentation improvement** that you think is necessary.
I may be able to provide a fix, or provide guidance on how to solve the
problem. There is also a smaller chance that I will ask for significant
changes to your pull request, or even reject it.

You don't have to contribute to this project.  However, if you choose to
contribute, please note that trivial changes will be rejected.  Here are some
examples of changes that will be rejected:

* fixing spelling or grammar mistakes in code or comments
* removing extra white space
* fixing code indentation
* changing names of functions and variables
